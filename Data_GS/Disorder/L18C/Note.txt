OBC = open boundary condition
PBC = periodic boundary condition
SPH = single particle Hamiltonian
MPH = many particle Hamiltonian
RR = return rate
LE = Loschmidt echo
del = delta dimerization (quench from -/+ to +/-)
W = disorder
GS = ground state

This folder has two data sets: W=0 and W=1e-8. The SSH model 
with OBC, L=18, SPH quenches from -0.95 to +0.95. The results are
averaged over 20,000 samples. 

Please run the .py files to see the plots for the data.
