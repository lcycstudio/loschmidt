OBC = open boundary condition
PBC = periodic boundary condition
SPH = single particle Hamiltonian
MPH = many particle Hamiltonian
RR = return rate
LE = Loschmidt echo
del = delta dimerization (quench from -/+ to +/-)
W = disorder
GS = ground state

This folder has two data sets: W=0 and W=0.01. The SSH model 
with OBC, L=800, SPH quenches from +0.5 to -0.5. The results are
averaged over 20,000 samples. 

Please run the .py files to see the plots for the data.

The plots are the same as we quench from +0.5 to -0.5 even though there
are disorderness.
