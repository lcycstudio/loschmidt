OBC = open boundary condition
PBC = periodic boundary condition
SPH = single particle Hamiltonian
MPH = many particle Hamiltonian
RR = return rate
LE = Loschmidt echo
del = delta dimerization (quench from -/+ to +/-)
W = disorder
GS = ground state


The OBC folder shows the comparions of the Loschmidt echo and its 
return rate between the results obtained from the SPH formula and 
the MPH formula for the SSH model, with open boundary condition, 
without disorder, for different system size L. 

The PBC folder shows the comparions of the Loschmidt echo and its 
return rate between the results obtained from the SPH formula, 
the MPH formula, and the analytical solution for the SSH model, 
with periodic boundary condition, without disorder, for different 
system size L. 

In all cases, the system quenches from del = -0.5 to del = + 0.5.
