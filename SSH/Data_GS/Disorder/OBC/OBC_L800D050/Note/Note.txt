SSH, OBC, SPH, RR
del = -0.5 -> +0.5
W = from 0.0 to 5e-14
L = 800
samples = 20,000


Because the results have .dat and .txt files, and this file is a .txt
file, I move the Note.txt to this folder to avoid conflicts.

This folder has several data: from W=0 to W=5e-14. The SSH model 
with OBC, L=800, quenches from -0.5 to +0.5. The results are
averaged over 20,000 samples. 

Please run the .py files to see the plots for the data.

Due to the numerical precision problem, the data for L=800 cannot produce
the correct return rate. Part of my thesis argument is to demonstrate 
the problem and show that there exists a hypothetical disorder value W for 
this sytem size L=800 if getting the return rate for this system size is 
computationally feasible.
