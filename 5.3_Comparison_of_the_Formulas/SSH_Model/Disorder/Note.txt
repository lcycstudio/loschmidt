OBC = open boundary condition
PBC = periodic boundary condition
SPH = single particle Hamiltonian
MPH = many particle Hamiltonian
RR = return rate
LE = Loschmidt echo
del = delta dimerization (quench from -/+ to +/-)
W = disorder
GS = ground state


In this folder, we compare the Loschmidt echo and return rate obtained
from both the SPH and the MPH for the SSH model with OBC. There are four 
data sets for different disorder W. The system size is L=14. The quench is 
from -0.5 to +0.5. The results show the results obtained from two calculations
are the same.
